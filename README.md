# DOCX-to-JSON-Converter

Usage

    Clone this repository or download the script to your local machine.
    Ensure your Python environment has the required python-docx dependency installed.
    Update the docx_folder_path and output_folder_path variables in the script to point to your input DOCX folder and desired output JSON folder, respectively.

How It Works

    The script scans the specified input directory for DOCX files, reads the text from each paragraph in every file, and then writes this text to a new JSON file in the specified output directory. Each JSON file will contain an array of paragraph texts from its corresponding DOCX file.
